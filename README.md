# play_test
MCL mini project

- Java version: Oracle JDK 1.8
- Compiled on Mac OS X v10.10.5

Not _totally_ complete (XML is still loaded in a horrible way, styling is bad and pagination doesn't exist), but it compiles so I will leave it as such for now. Oh and I tried, but I couldn't get 404 error handling to work with this version of play. See a commented-out override in Global.scala.
